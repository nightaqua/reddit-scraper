## 🔧 Configuration

### Streamlit Configuration

The app includes optimized Streamlit configuration in `.streamlit/config.toml`:

- **Theme**: Custom dark theme with Reddit-inspired colors
- **Performance**: Optimized caching and data handling
- **Security**: XSRF protection and secure headers

### 🔒 Password Protection (Optional)

The app supports an optional password gate to prevent unauthorized use of your Reddit API quota on public deployments.

**How to enable:** add `APP_PASSWORD` to your Streamlit secrets (Settings → Secrets in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard):

```toml
APP_PASSWORD = "your_strong_password_here"
```

If the variable is absent, the app runs without any lock screen — no change in behaviour for local or open deployments.

**Protections included:**

- After **3 failed attempts** (globally, across all browser sessions): a math CAPTCHA is required
- After **5 failed attempts**: a **60-second lockout** is enforced for all sessions simultaneously — opening a new tab does not reset the counter
- Password comparison uses constant-time `hmac.compare_digest()` to prevent timing attacks

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` | Reddit API client ID | `abcd1234efgh5678` |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Reddit API client secret | `your_secret_key_here` |
| `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` | User agent string | `RedditScraper/1.0 by /u/username` |
| `APP_PASSWORD` | Optional password gate | `your_strong_password_here` |

## 📊 Data Export

## 🔒 Privacy & Rate Limiting

- **Rate Limiting**: The app respects Reddit's API rate limits
- **Data Privacy**: No data is stored permanently; everything is processed in real-time
- **Caching**: Uses Streamlit's caching for better performance (1-hour TTL)
- **Security**: API credentials are handled securely through Streamlit secrets

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid credentials" error**:
   - Verify your Reddit API credentials
   - Ensure the user agent string is descriptive
   - Check that your Reddit app type is set to "script"

2. **"No posts found" error**:
   - Verify the subreddit name is correct
   - Check if the subreddit is private or banned
   - Try adjusting your date filters

3. **Rate limiting**:
   - The app automatically handles rate limits
   - If you hit limits, wait a few minutes before retrying

4. **App won't start**:
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
   - Verify Python version compatibility (3.8+)
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### Performance Tips

- Use specific date ranges instead of "All" for large subreddits
- Apply filters to reduce data volume
- Clear browser cache if the app becomes slow
